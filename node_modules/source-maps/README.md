# Source Maps

A purpose build source-maps library for combining and manipulating source-maps.

For just reading source-maps, this library does not outperform the probably more stable and well-known package `source-map` by Mozilla.

## Compile flatbuffer schema

```bash
cd ./src && ../flatc --cpp ./sourcemap-schema.fbs && cd ..
```
